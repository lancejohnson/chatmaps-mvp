# ChatMaps MVP

> Conversational Real Estate Data Platform

ChatMaps transforms how people explore and analyze real estate data by combining Large Language Models with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Users can ask natural language questions about properties and get both intelligent responses and interactive map visualizations.

## The Problem

Real estate data is trapped in complex databases that require technical expertise to query. Professionals, investors, and researchers waste hours learning specialized tools and writing complex queries to answer simple questions like "Show me all properties over 2 acres in Mountain View" or "What's the average property size on residential streets?"

## Our Solution

ChatMaps provides a conversational interface to property data that anyone can use:

- **Ask questions in plain English**: "Find large properties near downtown San Jose"
- **Get instant visual results**: Properties highlighted on an interactive map
- **Analyze data with simple questions**: "How many properties are over $2M in Palo Alto?"
- **Explore data intuitively**: "What zip codes are available in the database?"

## Technical Innovation

### AI-Powered Query Engine

- **OpenAI Function Calling**: Intelligently routes queries to specialized functions
- **LLM-Generated SQL**: Converts natural language to PostGIS spatial queries
- **Smart Query Classification**: Automatically detects search vs. analysis vs. lookup intent

### Real-Time Spatial Processing

- **PostGIS Database**: Enterprise-grade geographic database for complex spatial queries
- **Interactive Mapping**: Streamlit + Folium for responsive map visualization
- **Optimized Lookups**: Direct queries for APN, address, and coordinate searches

### Conversational Interface

```python
# Users ask questions like:
"Show me properties over 10,000 sq ft in Mountain View"
"How many homes are on Main Street?"
"Find parcel 123-45-678"
"What cities are available in the dataset?"

# System automatically:
1. Classifies query intent
2. Generates optimized SQL
3. Executes spatial queries
4. Returns chat response + map visualization
```

## Current Implementation

**Database**: Santa Clara County property parcels (500K+ records)

- Assessor Parcel Numbers (APNs)
- Complete address information  
- Property sizes and boundaries
- Geographic coordinates and shapes

**Core Functions**:

- **Property Search**: Find and visualize multiple properties
- **Statistical Analysis**: Counts, averages, totals by any criteria
- **Data Exploration**: List available values (cities, zip codes, street names)
- **Specific Lookups**: Direct property search by APN/address/coordinates
